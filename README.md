# Summary
* Crude storage peaked in 2020 as prices dipped below zero and bottomed out at -$40/BBL before rising up to $40/BBL. Inventories of both crude and gasoline have been dropping steadily but prices have traded within $2 for months. Floating storage in the US and China has likely dropped due to the available storage on land in America and with China opening its ports after the virus allowing shippers to unload their VLCCs. Even though storage has been dropping steadily, traders have not allowed the price to fluctuate more than $2 a barrel in months.

* Crude storage has decline 50 MMBBLs and gasoline storage has declined 30 MMBBLs since April of 2020. While inventories have steadily declined, the price of crude has stagnated  at $40/BBL and have remained steady. Crude will need to drop another 100 MMBBLs for prices to rise to the $60 to $70 range and at this time OPEC+ will likely increase supply to balance the market. Gasoline storage will drop until November when demand goes down and refiners begin to buy more crude.

* Demand for crude is expected to remain low in the winter after the summer driving months are over. Demand for natural gas rises in the winter due to the need for heating. Due to recent exports of natural gas, a decrease in the Appalachian region, and current political problems impacting the drilling in Wyoming, it is expected that natural gas prices will begin to rise in the winter.

The graph above shows how natural gas exports have risen over the years. Korea, China, and Japan are the biggest natural gas imports for the US. <p>

* OPEC+ will continue to curb supply until 2021 when they will see prices begin to rise. If prices rise, the organization will likely reduce cuts and flood the market like they have done in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The graph above shows how crude and gasoline storage ebb and flow over different years. In most years, crude storage peaks at the beginning of the year when demand is low and begins to decline in March as refiners buy more crude to refine into gasoline. This continues until the summer driving season is over when crude stocks begin to rise in October.



* The number of DUCs have risen exponentially over the past two years. There was a decrease in the number of DUCs at the end of 2019 continuing into 2020. The majority of DUCs are in the Permian Basin and can be quickly completed to make up for any lost production assuming prices rise again. This will also keep a lid on prices and provide companies with much needed cash flow.

# Future Market Trends
Demand for crude oil declines in the winter after the summer driving season is over. This cyclical event is compounded with the return of Covid-19 and lockdowns impacting the futures market. WTI dropped $3 over a slight build in inventories which indicates that oil prices will be depressed throughout the winter. OPEC+ has indicated that they will continue to pare back cuts to approximately 5.8 MMBPD on January 1st which is unlikely considering that oil prices will likely fall further over the winter unless there is a supply disruption. The organization has flooded the market in 2018, 2019, and again in 2020 so there is no reason why the organization will not do it again in the spring of 2021 when prices begin to rise. <p>

The election is too close to call and it is unclear what will happen after the election. Even if President Trump wins re-election, Democrats can still prevent oil and gas from being extracted through state and local laws penalizing fracing or banning it outright. If Democrats win, they could drive up the price of oil by decreasing supply, returning the US to a major importer. The Democrats could also impact oil demand by banning gas powered vehicles throughout the US. <p>
  
Natural gas demand will increase due to exports to Asia and the declining well count in the Appalachian and Barnet plays. Higher prices in the US will keep a lid on exports but China's growing consumption of natural gas and their rift with Australia will buoy exports. <p>
  
The price for WTI will average below $50/BBL for 2021 and will likely be below $45/BBL for most of the year. Prices for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and bunker fuel will be uneven. With the lockdown, gasoline will be in more demand and build ups of diesel and jet fuel will require more storage until the summer. Natural gas may fluctuate, especially if there is a cold winter in 2020/2021 but prices will rise in the long term. <p>
